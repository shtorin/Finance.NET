#### How do I get started?

First, configure AutoMapper to know what types you want to map, in the startup of your application:

```csharp
var configuration = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => 
{
    cfg.CreateMap<Foo, FooDto>();
    cfg.CreateMap<Bar, BarDto>();
});
// only during development, validate your mappings; remove it before release
#if DEBUG
configuration.AssertConfigurationIsValid();
#endif
// use DI (http://docs.automapper.org/en/latest/Dependency-injection.html) or create the mapper yourself
var mapper = configuration.CreateMapper();
```
Then in your application code, execute the mappings:

```csharp
var fooDto = mapper.Map<FooDto>(foo);
var barDto = mapper.Map<BarDto>(bar);
```

Check out the [getting started guide](https://automapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting-started.html). When you're done there, the [wiki](https://automapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) goes in to the nitty-gritty details. If you have questions, you can post them to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/automapper) or in our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/AutoMapper/AutoMapper).

### Where can I get it?
